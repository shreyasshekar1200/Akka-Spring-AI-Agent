PROJECT PROPOSAL: DISTRIBUTED
AKKA CLUSTER FOR LOCAL RAG &
KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL
1. Introduction and Motivation
In professional and academic environments, individuals accumulate vast libraries of local
documents (PDFs, research papers, notes). Standard keyword search is insufficient for
synthesizing answers or summarizing these complex materials.
This project proposes a distributed, domain-specific conversational agent designed to
serve as a "Personal Knowledge Assistant." The system will allow users to "talk" to their local
documents, providing accurate summaries and answers with specific source citations
(filename, page number).
Technically, this project will demonstrate a robust Akka Cluster architecture. It will leverage
Spring AI and Ollama for privacy-preserving local LLM processing and Neo4j as a Vector
Database. The system will be deployed across two distinct cluster nodes to simulate a
decoupled, scalable microservices environment.
